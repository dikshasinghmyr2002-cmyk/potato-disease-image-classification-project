# Potato Disease Classification using Deep Learning

This project focuses on the classification of potato leaf diseases using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The model is trained to classify potato leaves into three categories: Early Blight, Late Blight, and Healthy.

## Problem Statement
Potato crops are highly susceptible to leaf diseases, which can significantly reduce yield and quality. Early and accurate disease detection can help farmers take timely preventive measures.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is obtained from Kaggle:
[(https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/abdallahalidev/plantvillage-dataset)]
Only potato leaf images were used in this study. The selected classes include:
- Potato___Early_blight
- Potato___Late_blight
- Potato___Healthy

Due to size limitations, the full dataset is not uploaded to this repository.

## Methodology
- Image preprocessing and augmentation
- CNN-based model architecture
- Training and validation
- Model evaluation using accuracy and loss

## Technologies Used
- Python
- TensorFlow / Keras
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Jupyter Notebook

## Results
The trained model successfully classifies potato leaf diseases with high accuracy. Sample predictions along with confidence scores are visualized in the notebook.

## How to Run the Project
1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies using `requirements.txt`
3. Open the Jupyter Notebook
4. Run all cells sequentially

## Future Improvements
